# mystats
Some common statistical distributions calculation during my study of Statistics.

When I found the powerful sympy lib, I decided to quit continuing do this work and focus on the study itself. Maybe in future I will do something again.

For those who do the same thing like me, I recommand this powerful lib to you, both for utilization and study.
Here is the repository link: https://github.com/sympy/sympy
Or just tpye "sympy" to search in Git.
